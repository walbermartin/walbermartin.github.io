      <h2>Extraction and Isolation of Environmental Acetobacter for Nata Preparation</h2>
      <p>I was introduced to nata de coco by my Filipino friend in high school. Upon some research, I found that nata is naturally fermented from pineapple juice. I tried to culture acetobacter from fermented pinapple juice </p>

      <h2>Isolation and Identification of Yeast from Commercial Kombucha</h2>
      <p>This project was coupled with the gel simulator. I knew that strawberry DNA could be extracted with household detergents, and I wanted to see if the same could be done with yeast. It failed, likely because a strawberry is octoploid and the DNA that can be pulled is more than yeast.</p>

      <h2>Incubator</h2>
      <p>I made an incubator out of a home depo box, a heatlamp, and PID controlled Walmart burner. It can be set to a specified temperature and left to run. </p>
